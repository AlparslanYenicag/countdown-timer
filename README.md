# Countdown Timer

This is a simple and interactive **countdown timer** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Users can input a number of seconds, and the timer will count down and alert them when time’s up.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was created as part of a bootcamp homework assignment to practice:

- User input handling
- DOM manipulation
- `setInterval` and `clearInterval` usage
- CSS animations for visual feedback

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)

## 🧩 Features

- Accepts user input (in seconds)  
- Displays countdown in real-time  
- “Time’s up” message with blinking animation  
- Reset button to stop the timer and clear input

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to manage and display time dynamically  
- How to use timers and update the DOM  
- Basic animation using CSS keyframes  
- Creating responsive, user-friendly UI

## ⚠️ Known Bug

The `start` button’s function is slightly misspelled in the JS (`startCoumtdown`), but the code works as expected.  
Could be a fun little detail to fix for version 2.

## 👀 Why This Project Matters

Though basic, this timer project reflects practical JS skills and shows how simple logic can be turned into a functional, interactive tool.
